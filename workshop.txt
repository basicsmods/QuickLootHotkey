title=QuickLootHotkey
description=This mod seeks to make looting more efficient and comfortable for the player.
description=
description=Currently, the mod is in its infancy, but it works.
description=
description=Hover over any item in one of the inventory panes. Then press T to have that item be looted / dropped.
description=
description=If the item in question is already in your inventory, the item will be placed in whatever world container you currently have open (or the ground if none are open).
description=
description=If the item in question is on the ground / in a world container, it will be looted into your "best" container that has space. ("Best" is based on weight reduction. So it sort all your player's containers by weight reduction and attempt to place it in each one in that order. If none of your containers have room, it'll loot it onto your person.
description=
description=If you're hovering over a stack of items, it'll loot the whole stack.
description=
description=Hold control and press T to only move one item from the stack.
description=
description=Some things that I would like to add in the (hopefully) near future:
description=
description=- Make the hotkey customizable.
description=- Make the modifier hotkey (currently control) customizable.
description=- Add a "Move All" button / modifier.
description=- (Done) Make it so that keys automatically get placed in the keyring.
description=- Make it so that if you have multiple items selected (highlighted) that T will move all of them instead of only moving what is being moused over.
description=
description=I would love any and all feedback. If you find any issues or have any suggestions / requests, please comment and I'll do my best!
